## Overview
Join us in an immersive workshop led by Cindy Singleton, focusing on AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes. This workshop is ideal for those keen on mastering cloud infrastructure and automation.

## Key Lessons
- **Understanding AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes**: Grasp the fundamentals of these technologies and their integration.
- **Deploying an EKS Cluster via Command Line**: Learn the intricacies of deploying a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, emphasizing repeatability, quality, and speed.

## Hands-On Tasks
1. **Terraform Installation & Setup**: Install Terraform and set up `aws.tf` with your AWS credentials. 
  For this workshop, we will use a webtty console to access each student's lab environment. This means there's no need to install anything on your computer except a web browser. All code and credentials will be provided for you, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free learning experience.

2. **Step-by-Step Terraform Guide**: Progressively create `.tf` files for deploying an EKS cluster, covering VPC, subnets, IAM roles & policies, EKS setup, Node Group, Nginx, and load balancers.
3. **Launching Your Website**: Deploy and access your website on the EKS cluster.
4. **Cleanup**: End the workshop by safely destroying the created cluster using `terraform destroy`.
